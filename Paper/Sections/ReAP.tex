\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Methods for improving performance and energy consumption of SpMV on many-cores have been presented and analyzed. The issue addressed in the low operational-intensity of SpMV on very large matrices on external storage, resulting in I/O-bound execution. To reduce traffic from external storage, we apply BZIP2 lossless compression on top of CSR-based space-efficient sparse-matrix representation. The many-core is engaged in decompression, in addition to matrix multiplication. Trading additional computation off for reduced data read from external storage is shown beneficial, resulting in average speedup of 5 and average energy saving of 43\% on a set of sample large sparse matrices. 

The roofline model has been employed to explain the benefit of this approach and to provide architectural insight. The results may be extended beyond SpMV to any low operational-intensity computation on many-cores of big data sets.
